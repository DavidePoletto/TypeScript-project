<h2 align="center">Sunnee Beachwear - TypeScript Project</h2>
<p align="center">This project develops a system in TypeScript to model the operational structure of Sunnee, a sustainable beachwear brand dedicated to producing swimwear, sarongs, and hats made from recycled plastic.</p>

<h3 align="center">Project Objective</h3>

## Key Features
- Definition of interfaces (IProduct, IClient, IProductionProcess) to represent the various components of the system.
- Implementation of classes (Product, Client, ProductionProcess) that adhere to the defined interfaces.
- Linking logic that manages product assignment to customers and the addition of new items to production processes.
- Testing of logic through object instantiation and method invocation.
